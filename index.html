                I will dearly miss Steve Jobs he inspired me to keep getting the iphones 
                I have loved them ever since the first one. Steve Jobs was a great man and a awesome CEO for APPLE. 
                He has inspired me to one day and go for and work with the apple when 
                I get old but my dream is to own Apple and 
                follow by Steve Jobs way and make Apple greater than before it was. 
                But I will dearly miss Steve Jobs he’s a great man and I will never forget him.

            <p>
                As I heard this sad news via my iPhone I am emailing my condolences from my MacBook Pro. 
                Steve has left a fingerprint on our culture that cannot be rivaled and will be long lasting. 
                My deepest sympathy to his family and friends.

            <h4>Steve Jobs</h4>
            <p>
                What impact has Steve Jobs had on my life? Every short story I’ve written as an adult 
                (and certainly every one that has been published), almost every email I’ve ever written, 
                has been written on machines created by Apple. I interacted online using an Apple machine 
                long before I even encountered a PC Steve Jobs helped to realize the Star Trek future 
                I dreamed of as a kid. 
                And through his vision, 
                I have been able to realize my own. You’ll be missed, Mr. Jobs. Thanks for all your amazing work.

            <h4>He’s gone…</h4>
            <p>
                A part of my heart has cracked. I didn’t know him personally but I felt like I knew him. 
                I will forever remember him. I’m still saddened because he was taken too soon. 
                I can only imagine his struggles. Heaven has certainly gained an angel.

            <p>
                Dear Steve’s family, dear Apple company I can’t find words how to describe my feelings… 
                For me Apple means a lot – I got a good job using Apple products, 
                I have found a new lifestyle thanks to Apple.
                And, of course, I’ve been always admiring your products. And for me everything in 
                Apple is connected with Steve. 
                I do hope he’ll be remembered around the world as a genius.
